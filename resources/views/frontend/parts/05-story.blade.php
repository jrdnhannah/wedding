                                </h4>
                                <p>Around five and a half years ago, Jordan was working at the WHSmith in Aldershot,
                                    when Carly bought a copy of Kerrang!, sparking up a conversation about our interest
                                    in music and our favourite bands. Unfortunately, we were both too nervous to ask for
                                    each others numbers, and both thought that would be that.</p>

                                <p>We didn't quite realise how wrong we were though. Unbeknownst to Jordan and Carly, they
                                    travelled within the same small group of friends - just never at the same time, it
                                    seemed! Not too long after meeting in WHSmith, Jordan &amp; Carly crossed paths again
                                    at our local rock music venue, the Agincourt. They sparked up a conversation, and
                                    refused to let it end like the time at WHSmith.</p>

                                <p>Jordan &amp; Carly dated casually for a short while, before starting University. A decision
                                    had to be made as the Universities were quite a distance from each other, but it was
                                    decided that this was definitely worth a shot - they had something too good to let go.</p>

                                <p>After two years of travelling across the country, sitting on many trains and looking forward
                                    to many weekends, Carly started at Swansea Metropolitan University and moved in with
                                    Jordan in Swansea.</p>

                                <p>Jordan and Carly quickly settled in to living together with some housemates spending evenings
                                    watching films and cooking together.</p>
                                <p>They also spent time getting involved with their students union and making friends through
                                    this. They went to Waterfront Wonderland each christmas and Mumbles each summer
                                    starting traditions in the life they have made together in Swansea</p>

                                    proposal</h4>
                                <p>On the 26<sup>th</sup> of March, 2016 Jordan took Carly out for a meal at their now
                                    favourite restaurant. After a perfect meal, they left and decided to go for a
                                    walk along the beach just as they had many times before. This time it was different.</p>

                                <p>Unbeknownst to Carly, Jordan had enlisted the help of some friends to set up an area
                                    on the beach for the proposal. With bottles with glow-sticks in the shape of a heart and giggles
                                from their friends coming from the darkness beyond, the question was asked.
                                Through many giggles and smiles, "Yes!" was exclaimed! Celebrations and drinks with
                                    friends at a local pub were waiting. </p>

                                <p>Months later, Rivervale Barn, October 25th 2016 was planned and so we are inviting you, our family
                                and friends to attend a wonderful day ahead.</p>
